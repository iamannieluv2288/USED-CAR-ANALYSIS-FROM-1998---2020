This project involved analyzing a dataset of used cars to identify key factors influencing prices and market trends. The analysis focused on seven critical aspects: price trends, fuel type distribution, transmission preferences, brand dominance, mileage-to-price relationships, location-based pricing, and seating capacity averages.

METHODS AND TOOLS USED:

1. Data Collection and Cleaning:

I started by downloading the dataset using a link provided on cargo.com. After obtaining the data, I uploaded it into Power BI and performed data cleaning. This involved applying filters to remove irrelevant or inconsistent data.

2. Data Aggregation:

Next, I focused on data aggregation. I identified key metrics in the dataset, such as price trends, transmission types, fuel types, and geographical locations. These metrics helped shape the foundation of the analysis.

3. Data Visualization:

For visualization, I utilized various chart types, including bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and grid charts, to uncover insights. Additionally, I incorporated interactive filters to allow dynamic exploration of the data, such as filtering by car names, locations, using the top 5 filter.

 

 TOOLS USED

Â·         The tools used in this analysis were Excel dataset and Power BI  for data handling and visualization.

6. Final Dashboard:

Finally, I created a dashboard to present the entire analysis. This dashboard consolidates all insights and visualizations, making it accessible and user-friendly for anyone who views it.

 

KEY INSIGHTS:

1.Price Trend: The analysis reveals a significant increase in the average price of used cars over time. Cars from 1996-1998 recorded the lowest prices, while 2016 models had the highest average price of 8.6k. This trend indicates that older cars generally have lower prices.

2.Fuel Type Distribution: Diesel cars are the most popular, with a total count of 1,055, compared to 932 petrol cars. Other fuel types, such as CNG, LPG, and Electric, have minimal representation.

3.Transmission Preference: Manual transmission cars dominate the market, accounting for 57.68% of the price share, while automatic cars contribute 42.32%. However, automatic cars tend to have higher average prices.

4.Brand Dominance in High-Price Segment: Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar, and Audi lead the high-price segment, with Mercedes-Benz having the highest price contribution. This indicates that Mercedes-Benz is both widely used and highly valued.

5.Mileage and Price Relationship: Cars with higher mileage values, such as 9.8 kmpl, 9.7 kmpl, and 9.74 kmpl, typically have lower prices. Conversely, cars with better mileage tend to command higher prices.

6.Location-Based Price Averages: Mumbai has the highest average car price at 7.45k, followed by Kochi at 7.25k. In contrast, Pune and Kolkata report significantly lower averages of 4.18k and 3.03k, respectively.

7.Seating Capacity: The average number of seats is 5.28, a figure characteristic of sedans and SUVs. This suggests limited representation of smaller cars or larger passenger vehicles in the data.

 

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1.Concentrate on Popular Fuel kinds for increased sales potential, think about focusing on vehicles that use gasoline and diesel, as these fuel kinds that are the most common.

2. Target Urban Areas for Higher costs concentrate marketing efforts in areas where average costs are higher, as this indicates a market for luxury or premium autos.

3. Promote Automatic automobiles since automatic automobiles are more expensive and sell more, they are a good target market.

4. Examine the Manual Transmission Niche to take advantage of the demand for manual automobiles, highlight quality or scarcity in your marketing if they are more expensive.

5. Luxury Car Brands since they generate more sales, car brands that top the "Top 5 Highest Price" list ought to be given more attention in your inventory.

6. Take Mileage into Account When Setting Prices Low-mileage cars may give larger profits because their total prices are higher than those of strategy cars with lower mileage.

7. Keep a range of automobile names that correspond to the ones with the largest sales and pricing by stocking popular car brands.

8. Dealer Partnerships: If a single owner owns a large number of vehicles, there might be a chance to form alliances with dealerships to sell in bulk.

9. Emphasize Low Mileage for Value: In your listings, emphasize the fact that cars with lower mileage are usually more desirable.

10. Provide promotions or financing for cars with high mileage. To make high-mileage cars more appealing, think about providing financing or rebates if their total cost is higher.
